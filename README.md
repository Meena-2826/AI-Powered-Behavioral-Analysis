AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis for Suicide Prevention, Substance Use, and Mental Health Crisis Detection with Longitudinal Geospatial Crisis Trend Analysis

Mental Health, Suicide Prevention, and Substance Use Early-Warning System


📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-driven public health monitoring system to detect emerging mental health crises by analyzing real-time social media data. It goes beyond basic sentiment analysis by integrating:

🚨 Behavioral Escalation Patterns

🧠 Crisis-Related Language Detection

🌍 Geospatial Trend Mapping

📊 Interactive Crisis Dashboards

🔮 Predictive Indicators of Mental Health Decline

This system is designed to help public health agencies and mental health professionals respond to crises before they become critical.

🌟 Unique Features
✅ Sentiment Escalation Monitoring
Uses temporal tracking of user sentiment to detect worsening mental states.

✅ Transformer-Based Detection of Coded Language
Fine-tuned BERT models are used to decode slang, emojis, and coded speech commonly used in mental health discussions.

✅ Geospatial + Longitudinal Analysis
Tracks changes in mental health discourse across regions over time to predict crisis hotspots.

✅ Interactive Public Health Dashboard
A real-time dashboard to visualize:

Heatmaps of crisis discussions

Escalation timelines

Outreach campaign effectiveness

📈 Example Output

Real-time distress mapping in high-risk regions.


Sentiment shift tracking over 30 days.

🧩 Tech Stack
Python (NLP, data pipelines)

Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)

NLTK, spaCy (Lexicon-based analysis)

Plotly, Dash, Folium (Visualization)

GeoPandas (Geospatial analysis)

Google Colab (Notebook Execution)

🎯 GSoC Impact
This project aligns with HumanAI’s mission by offering:

Scalable public health insights using open-source AI

Proactive detection of mental health crisis hotspots

A framework to inform interventions before it's too late

I plan to build on this foundation with:

🔍 Multilingual support for global crisis detection

💬 Conversational AI for mental health support

🛰️ Integration with local crisis resource databases
